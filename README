Or you could run examples directly on an Overo COM with wifi through ssh, with USB Console disconnected. For example,
  Setup COM's Wifi, make sure it automatically start after system booting
  Fetch code in COM
  SSH to COM(change the ip address to your COM's ip)
    $ ssh root@192.168.0.1
  Run example as above
    $ python launcher.py run IMU
